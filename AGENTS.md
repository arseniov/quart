## Memory (GrayMatter)

You have persistent memory through the `graymatter` MCP tools. Hooks and MCP are
complementary; neither replaces the other. MCP wiring alone only makes tools
available; this briefing and optional Claude Code hooks define when they run.

This block may reach projects without GrayMatter. If `memory_search` is
not in your toolbelt for this session, skip this section. This is not a
judgement call about usefulness: when the tools exist, everything below applies.

### Your identity

Your `agent_id` is the name of this repository's root directory, used verbatim
every session. Add a `-<role>` suffix only when several agents share the repo
(`myapp-backend`, `myapp-frontend`). Inventing a new id per session scatters
your facts across namespaces and looks exactly like memory being broken.

Facts every agent in the project should see go to the reserved id `__shared__`.

### Every session, without exception

1. **Resuming long-running work**: call `checkpoint_resume` first.
2. **Before your first substantive reply**, inspect only the newest hook block
   available for the session's initial turn; ignore quoted examples and blocks
   from older turns. A real recall block begins with a bracketed
   `GrayMatter hook recall ran` marker
   naming its `agent_id`. If that id differs from the `agent_id` you would
   search, run both project and `__shared__` searches: cross-namespace dedup may
   have placed a shared duplicate under `## Memory`. When the ids match, reuse
   each non-empty section and run the search for every missing section. Fold
   all results into your working context before answering.
3. A fresh marker suppresses only those matching routine searches. Keep using
   `memory_search` or `memory_search_batch` for focused, ad-hoc lookups; hooks
   do not replace MCP writes, reflections, aliases, or checkpoint tools.
4. **Before you stop**, store what you learned (see the table) and call
   `checkpoint_save` if the task is unfinished.

### What triggers a call

| When this happens | Call |
|---|---|
| The newest hook block has a different id | `memory_search` for both the project and `__shared__` |
| A same-id hook block lacks a non-empty section | `memory_search` for that missing scope |
| You need additional or focused context | `memory_search` or `memory_search_batch` |
| The user states a preference | `memory_add` |
| You discover a project convention | `memory_add` with `agent_id: "__shared__"` |
| You make a non-obvious decision | `memory_add`, include the reasoning |
| You fix a non-trivial bug or find a workaround | `memory_add` |
| The user corrects you | `memory_reflect` with `action="update"` |
| A stored fact becomes wrong | `memory_reflect` with `action="update"` or `action="forget"` (never `"unpin"`) |
| The user or authoritative project policy declares a stored fact permanent | `memory_reflect` with `action="pin"` |
| A pinned fact is still true but no longer needs permanence | `memory_reflect` with `action="unpin"` |
| A search comes back with a **weak-match note** | Reformulate **once** with the note's suggested terms; if your wording and the store's differ, declare it with `memory_alias` before trying more synonyms |

Prefer durable, actionable, atomic conclusions; skip low-signal, duplicate,
or transient information. Stored facts add retrieval/decay cost. Pin only
facts explicitly designated permanent by the user or authoritative project
guidance.

### The tools

| Tool | Required | Optional |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_search` | `agent_id`, `query` | `top_k` (default 8), `explain`, `min_confidence`, `confidence_weight` |
| `memory_search_batch` | `agent_id`, `queries` | `top_k` (default 8), `min_confidence`, `confidence_weight` |
| `memory_add` | `agent_id`, `text` | `confidence` |
| `memory_reflect` | `action`, `agent_id` (or deprecated `agent` alias) | `text`, `target` (required by action), `confidence` (add/update only) |
| `memory_alias` | `agent_id`, `term`, `equivalents` | teach the store a vocabulary bridge |
| `checkpoint_save` | `agent_id` | `state` |
| `checkpoint_resume` | `agent_id` | `on_missing`: `"error"` (default) or `"empty"` when no checkpoint is ordinary control flow |

`agent_id` is canonical for every tool. `memory_reflect` also accepts the
deprecated `agent` alias; at least one is required at runtime. Each supplied
identity must be a non-empty string, not only whitespace;
`agent_id` wins when both are valid. Valid namespace bytes are preserved.

Confidence declares `verified`/`inferred`/`unverified`; GrayMatter does not verify it.
Omitted add is inferred; update takes the weakest target, capped at inferred.
`min_confidence` filters before ranking and suppresses graph hints.
`confidence_weight` accepts [0,0.5], defaults to 0, and zero keeps filters.
`explain` reports final scores. Unsupported options require a daemon update/restart;
never replay uncertain writes.

### The store learns its own vocabulary

Teach vocabulary bridges with `memory_alias`. Optional usage learning can also
promote repeated reformulations. `graymatter alias list` distinguishes `authored`
and `usage` aliases; revise incorrect mappings.

### Store conclusions, not transcripts

One idea per call. Skip anything already in the code or the README, anything
transient (that is what checkpoints are for), and never store secrets.
